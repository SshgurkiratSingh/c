[2024-07-22 15:12:44] AI: The `dd` command in Linux is primarily used for converting and copying files. It's often employed for tasks such as creating disk images, backing up data, and manipulating raw device files.

### Common Syntax:
```bash
dd if=<input file> of=<output file> [options]
```
- `if=` specifies the input file.
- `of=` specifies the output file.
- Options can include `bs=` (block size), `count=` (number of blocks), and others.
