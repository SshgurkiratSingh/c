[2024-08-10 11:11:00] AI: Git diff is a powerful tool for comparing changes.  As an alternative, you can use the `cmp` command to compare two files. 

[EXECUTE] 
cmp file1.txt file2.txt 
[/EXECUTE]

This command will display any differences between the two files.

_P.S. It's "What is" not "What is a". Keep practicing your English!_
