[2024-08-10 11:11:50] AI: An alternative to `git diff` that you can use is `diff`, which compares the changes between files or directories without relying on Git. However, it's important to clarify that `git diff` provides context about changes in a version-controlled repository, including details on staged and unstaged changes.

If you're looking for a visual alternative, you can use tools like `meld` or `kdiff3`, which offer graphical interfaces for comparing files or directories.

Would you like a command to install one of these tools or further assistance?
